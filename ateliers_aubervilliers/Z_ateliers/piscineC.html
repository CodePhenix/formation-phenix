======================================./level00-count_of_2.txt=========================================
Assignment name  : count_of_2
Expected files   : count_of_2.c
Allowed functions: None
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement a function which counts, for a given integer n, the number of 2s
that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).
Your function must be declared as follows:
int    count_of_2(int n);
If n <= 1, the function returns 0;
Examples:
input  = 25
output =  9
because there are 9 2s in (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25)
Note:
the number 22 counts as 2 because it has two 2s, number 202 count as 2, number 22022 count as 4 etc
==========================================================================================




======================================./level00-equation.txt=========================================
Assignment name  : equation
Expected files   : equation.c
Allowed functions: printf
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this exercise is to find all possible answers to the following
equation :

	AB + CA = n

where A, B, and C are individual digits [0-9] and n is an integer.
Note that here AB is not the product of A and B. It is merely a two digit number
with A being the first digit (tens place) and B the second digit (ones place).

Implement a function that, given an integer n, prints on the standard
output all the possible values of A, B, C for which the equation is true.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void    equation(int n);

If a solution could not be found, nothing is printed.
Examples:
For the value n = 42, the output would be :
$> ./equation 42
A = 0, B = 2, C = 4
A = 1, B = 1, C = 3
A = 2, B = 0, C = 2
A = 3, B = 9, C = 0
$>
For the value n = 111, the output would be :
$> ./equation 111
A = 2, B = 9, C = 8
A = 3, B = 8, C = 7
A = 4, B = 7, C = 6
A = 5, B = 6, C = 5
A = 6, B = 5, C = 4
A = 7, B = 4, C = 3
A = 8, B = 3, C = 2
A = 9, B = 2, C = 1
$>
For the value n = 0, the output would be :
$> ./equation 0 | cat -e
A = 0, B = 0, C = 0$
$>

Note:
- The displayed output will always be sorted in ascending order beginning with A, then B and then C.
(as shown in the examples above)

======================================./level00-find_pivot.txt=========================================
Assignment name  : find_pivot
Expected files   : find_pivot.c
Allowed functions: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALERT: OPTIMIZED SOLUTION REQUIRED.
Given an array of integers and its size passed as parameters,
create a function able to return the pivot index of this array.
The pivot index is the index where the sum of the numbers on the left
is equal to the sum of the numbers on the right.
The function must be declared as follows:
    int find_pivot(int *arr, int n);
If there is no pivot present, return -1.
Considerations:
- Be careful: the naive solution won't work on our big input, you have to
find an optimized solution which will run in O(n) time (where n is the
